# meal-planner
A Ruby-on-Rails app for managing recipes and periodic shopping lists

## Overview

This app is a Ruby-on-Rails (RoR) app. The purpose of the app is keep recipes with their ingredients. While there are a number of sites that do this, the idea here is to provide a service that will put together a shopping list and meal plan for the week to minimize the ammount of shopping and prep time. The end result is an app that users will rely on to maximize their time efficiency while cooking at home.

## Development

In reality, this project will **not** be perfect. It's meant as a place to casual practice Rails principles. There will likely be some missing specs/unit tests and incomplete pieces. This is because this is a side project that is being worked on it fits and bursts on evenings and weekends - not something that has full time development.

### Branch Conventions

The `master` branch is used as the mainline branch. Staging and Production will be cut off of master. All features, even small ones, should be made in feature branches (`feature/<issue>/description`) that are rebased, not merged, into master.
